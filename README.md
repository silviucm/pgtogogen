# pgtogogen
Pgtogogen is a Postgres-entities-to-Go structures generator with the low-level db connectivity details handled by Jack Christensen's pgx project  (https://github.com/jackc/pgx).
The project was started in late 2014, committed to GitHub in early 2015, and I've kept adding features sporadically even since.

### Status: In Progress
The project is partially functional. As is the case with most GitHub projects, use it at your own risk. 

### Installation
To install the tool, run:
```bash
 go get -u github.com/silviucm/pgx
 go get -u github.com/silviucm/pgtogogen
```
	
### Generating the model package	
Assuming an empty subdirectory named "models" exists in the location where you will run the command:
```bash
 pgtogogen -h=localhost -n=mydatabasename -u=mydatabaseuser -pass=mydatabasepassword
```

### Usage

Initialize the database (do it in the main init() function or as soon as possible in the main() function):

```go
 	// the models package is the one generated by the tool (e.g. github.com/yourproject/models)
	var poolMaxConnections int = 100
	_, err := models.InitDatabaseMinimal("192.168.0.1", 5432, "hellouser", "hellopass", "mydatabase", poolMaxConnections)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("FAIL:", err.Error())
	} else {
		fmt.Println("OK.")
	}
```
